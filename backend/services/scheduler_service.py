"""Spaced-repetition scheduling for chunks.

Wraps the `fsrs` package (the canonical Python implementation of FSRS-4) so the
rest of the codebase doesn't import from `fsrs` directly. The scheduler decides
when a chunk is next due for review based on the user's self-grade after each
review.

Why FSRS instead of SM-2 (Anki's classic algorithm):
- FSRS models stability and difficulty as separable parameters, where SM-2
  conflates them into a single ease factor.
- FSRS is fit on millions of real-world reviews, SM-2's parameters are hand-set.
- Empirically: FSRS converges on the user's desired retention rate (default 90%)
  with ~30% fewer reviews than SM-2 for the same retention target.

The full algorithm and weight derivation are documented at
https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm.
